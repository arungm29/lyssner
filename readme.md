# Overview
Lyssner is an omegle-like anonymous chat service. The user can choose to be a listener or a venter. Listeners and venters are then paired up, and are allowed to talk to each other.

A demo is currently live at http://lyssner.arunmahadevan.me/.


# Installation

First, install all the node modules using `npm install`. Then use `node server.js` to get the server running, and open localhost on your browser at port 8080.
